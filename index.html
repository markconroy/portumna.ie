            <h3>About the training plan</h3>
          </summary>
          <p>The first few weeks of your training will mainly consist of brisk walking to prepare your body for running. </p>
          <p>Regular brisk walks are a great way to strengthen your muscles and tendons and elevate your heart rate - making you fitter and ready to start your running journey with less chance of injury. On indicated rest days you can cross train - cycling or swimming if you like, but it is not a necessity. </p>
          <p>These initial weeks are designed to get you into the habit of getting out the door, to train regularly, even if it is only walking at this stage. </p>
          <p>Maintaining a regular and consistent training schedule will be the single most important step in your running journey.</p>
          <p>On Monday 13 January you will begin your specific running schedule, which will be posted here. It will give you two months of targeted running training which will prepare you to tackle the Portumna 10K on 16 March 2025. </p>
