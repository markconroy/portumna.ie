        <h1>Portumna 10k Run, March 16th 2025</h1>
        <h2>Tickets</h2>
        <p>The 10k race is sold out. There are still some places available for the junior 1k race.</p>
        <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/portumna-10k-run-tickets-1127583395289" class="get-tickets">Get Tickets</a>

        <p>Time is almost upon us for the inaugural Portumna 10k, which we're billing as "the most beautiful race in Ireland" - through forest, along lake shore, beside the Shannon, and much more. Here's all the details you will need for the day. </p>

        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>Registration is now closed. We have capacity for 500 and expected we'd have about 250 for our inaugural race. We can't believe we have sold every ticket. </p>

        <h2>Parking</h2>
        <p>We have lots of parking available in Portumna. For race day, the official car park is Portumna Mart - https://maps.app.goo.gl/ubLomQdh6f6DVSeY9. If the mart is full (it shouldn't be, it has space for about 500 cars), there should be plenty of parking space along the road outside the mart and also around the castle/library/playground area.</p>

        <h2>Sign in</h2>
        <p>Every participant must sign in on the morning of the race. At sign in you will be given your number, pins and race pack. Sign in starts at 9am and ends at 11am sharp. The venue for sign in is The Muscle Mill - https://maps.app.goo.gl/oeAjJ1qi9qWBk4FV6 (just down from SuperValu). Make sure you give yourself enough time to leave your race pack back to your car if you need to.</p>

        <h2>Junior Race</h2>
        <p>The junior race starts at 11:30 sharp. To facilitate this, all juniors must be ready outside The Muscle Mill at 11:15 to walk to the start line. The start line will be near Portumna Mart. The race is a 1km run around the block, finishing at The Muscle Mill. </p>

        <h2>10k Race</h2>
        <p>The 10k race will start at 12:00 sharp. We ask all participants to congregate on the path outside the Muscle Mill from about 11:45. We will let people on to the road from about 11:55 just before we are ready to start. </p>

        <h2>Race Roue</h2>
        <p>The race begins outside the Muscle Mill. You will run through the town and out St Joseph's Road until you get to Portumna Forest Park (2km). Turn into the forest and follow the main avenue, then the accessible trail from the forest car park to Portumna Marina (5k). From here follow the new pathway from the marina to Lough Derg (affectionately known as "the swimming area"). There will be a water station at the swimming area (6k). Continue through the swimming area and run along the banks of the Shannon on the new blueway (thanks Waterways Ireland) up to the bridge (8k). Turn left at the bridge and head back in to town. When you get to the starting point (The Muscle Mill) you will be at 9.6km. The finish line is near the town square, 400 metres past The Muscle Mill.</p>

        <p>If you want a preview of the race route you can see it on this Strava activity - https://www.strava.com/activities/13863307121. </p>

        <h2>Marshals</h2>
        <p>We have 50+ marshals along the route to help you and cheer you on. Thanks to Portumna Transition Years for helping facilitate this. If you hear music, sing along ... dance if you wish. At all times be respectful to our marshals - they are all volunteers - and follow their instructions.</p>

        <h2>Litter</h2>
        <p>Many marshals will have bags with them. If you are finished a bottle of water or a gel, please throw them in the direction of the marshals to help make our clean up a little easier. </p>

        <h2>Prizes</h2>
        <p>We have the following prizes: </p>

        <h2>Shops Open</h2>
        <p>With 500 participants in the 10k, about 200 in the junior race, and lots of supporters coming, the population of Portumna is going to double on Sunday. Most businesses in the Chamber of Commerce have agreed to open on Sunday to showcase all the great things we have in the town. You won't be stuck for coffee, tea, or any other kind of drink or snack. Please support our local businesses as well as those trading in the square after the race.</p>

        <p>We wish you the very best with this 10k, whether you are running, walking or a combination of both.</p>
